Elizabeth it is in vain you say
Love not"thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breath it less gently forthand veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his lovewas cured of all beside
His follieprideand passionfor he died.
